**SAM 3D Objects** is a foundation model that reconstructs full 3D shape geometry, texture, and layout from a single image, excelling in real-world scenarios with occlusion and clutter by using progressive training and a data engine with human feedback. It outperforms prior 3D generation models in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We released code, weights, online demo, and a new challenging benchmark.

## Latest updates

**11/19/2025** - Checkpoints Launched, Web Demo and Paper are out.

## Installation

Follow the [setup](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-objects/blob/main/doc/setup.md) steps before running the following.

## Single or Multi-Object 3D Generation

SAM 3D Objects can convert masked objects in an image, into 3D models with pose.

<img src="doc/kidsroom.png" width="49%" style="display: inline-block;"/><img src="doc/kidsroom_transparent.gif" width="49%" style="display: inline-block;"/>


For a quick start, use the the following lines of code:

```python
import sys

# import inference code
sys.path.append("notebook")
from inference import Inference, load_image, load_single_mask

# load model
tag = "hf"
config_path = f"checkpoints/{tag}/pipeline.yaml"
inference = Inference(config_path, compile=False)

# load image (RGBA only, mask is embedded in the alpha channel)
image = load_image("notebook/images/shutterstock_stylish_kidsroom_1640806567/image.png")
mask = load_single_mask("notebook/images/shutterstock_stylish_kidsroom_1640806567", index=14)

# run model
output = inference(image, mask, seed=42)

# export gaussian splat
output["gs"].save_ply(f"splat.ply")
```

For  more details and multi-object reconstruction, please take a look at out two jupyter notebooks:
* [single object](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-objects/blob/main/notebook/demo_single_object.ipynb)
* [multi object](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-objects/blob/main/notebook/demo_multi_object.ipynb)

## SAM 3D Body

[SAM 3D Body (3DB)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-body) is a robust promptable foundation model for single-image 3D human mesh recovery (HMR).

As a way to combine the strengths of both **SAM 3D Objects** and **SAM 3D Body**, we provide an example notebook that demonstrates how to combine the results of both models such that they are aligned in the same frame of reference. Check it out [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-objects/blob/main/notebook/demo_3db_mesh_alignment.ipynb).
